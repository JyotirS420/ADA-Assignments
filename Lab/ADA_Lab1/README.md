Conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm#:~:text=The%20divide%2Dand%2Dconquer%20paradigm,to%20solve%20the%20given%20problem)  

For aynone wondering where `ProblemB.cpp` is, Problem A and Problem B were the same questions only being different in which time complexities were acceptable.  
Therefore, I implemented Problem A with a time complexity that worked for Problem B as well.
